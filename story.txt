8:00 Wake up. Sylvester slowly crawls out of bed. Every morning the first thing he thinks about is his daughter. The dragon that
took her is the only thing on his mind. Sylvester combs his fur as he stares into his eyes through his bathroom mirror. He feels the cold
smooth metal of his newly added robotic arm. Its hard to be a robotic bear in this world. The mamal instincts of Sylvester's mind are 
pestered by the cold blooded cybertronic additions to his body. But he would make those choices again. In order to get his daughter back
Sylvester couldn't just be a bear. He had to be THE bear. Sylvester moves through his house, packing his bags. This will be a long
journey to the dragon's lair. Any mistep, any mistake could be futile. Sylvester slams his door and walks into the light of day, 
commiting to making it to they dragon's home, slaying him, and taking back his daughter.
